BANK WORKTEST
Building Instructions
=====================

This directory contains all source code, documentation and build files needed to complete
the bank worktest assignment. Please read 'bank_worktest.pdf' for full instructions.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to build and run the project you will need the following tools:

 * JDK 1.7+
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

 * Apache Maven 3+
   http://maven.apache.org

Build Instructions
------------------

To compile and test your solution, run:

    mvn clean test

If you have additional dependencies just add them to the pom.xml accordingly.

To find a specific dependency, go to http://search.maven.org/.

If a dependency is not available in the public Maven repo, you need to add
the jar file to a lib directory and use system scope to point it out
in the pom.xml.

Example:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.lib</groupId>
    <artifactId>stuff</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
    <type>jar</type>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/stuff-1.2.3.jar</systemPath>
</dependency
